"""
We are going to model points in 2D space as objects of a class named Point.
Define a class named Point that has the following specification:

Attributes
    (1) x: int, x-coordinate of the point in 2D space.
    (2) y: int, y-coordinate of the point in 2D space.

Methods
    self is the first argument of all methods. We will only mention the
additional arguments, if any.
    (1) __init__: constructor with two arguments â€” x and y; assign these two
values to the corresponding attributes within the constructor
    (2) distance: return the distance of the point from the origin as a float
value
    (3) is_origin: return True if the point coincides with the origin, and
False otherwise
    (4) on_xaxis: return True if the point is on the x-axis, and False
otherwise
    (5) on_yaxis: return True if the point is on the y-axis and False otherwise
    (6) quadrant: return the quadrant that this point belongs to; assume that
this method will only be called if the point is not on either of the axes;
possible return values are ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].
    (7) slope: return the slope of the line joining the origin and this point
as a float value; assume that this method will only be called if the point
is not on the y-axis
